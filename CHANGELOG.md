# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versions are the Thue++ spec versions in `SPEC_VERSION`.

## [Unreleased]

## [v0.5] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- Default applied-step limit of 1000000 on a new interpreter, matching the probe default. `unlimited`, `nil`, `None`, or JSON `null` clears it.
- Distinct resource-limit exits: 10 applied steps, 11 probes, 12 state size, 13 `::<` read timeout. The stderr text is the same in Python, Go, and wasm.
- Host reason for a limit stop: Go `*LimitError` (`Kind`, `ExitCode`, `Message`), Python `LimitExceeded` (`.kind`, `.code`), wasm result field `limit`.
- `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** `--max-steps` / `MaxSteps` / `maxSteps` no longer exits 0. The Nth applied rewrite exits 10 with `Applied step limit (N) exceeded`, and the run does not scan further. A run that quiesces before N rewrites exits 0. `::-` does not consume a step. `--max-steps 0` applies nothing.
- **Breaking:** `--max-evals` exits 11. `--max-state-bytes` exits 12. A `::<` read timeout exits 13. Those stops used to exit 1. Exit 1 remains any other runtime error. Exit 2 remains CLI usage.
- **Breaking:** omitting `--max-steps` uses 1000000. It used to mean no step limit.
- **Breaking:** the wasm run option `stepLimit` is `maxSteps`.
- Spec version is v0.5. The exit table is in `docs/host-api.md`, `docs/conformance.md`, `docs/implementers.md`, and `docs/rfc-language.md`.

### Removed

- Silent stop when the applied-step limit was hit. The CLI no longer rewrites a limit exit to 1.

### Fixed

- The playground Step and Continue controls treat a one-rewrite limit stop as a step. The limit line stays out of the stderr pane. End still reports a real limit stop.

## [v0.4] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- Default limits on a new interpreter: 1000000 rule probes and 8388608 bytes of state. `unlimited` clears either one. `0` is a real limit.
- Host metering and trace: probe count, applied-step count, and an optional trace of applied rewrites (`docs/host-api.md`).
- GitLab Pages publishes the demo as a static site for thuelang.org, with deep links for `/playground`, `/embed`, and `/embed/demo`.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** a host that omitted the probe or state limit used to be unbounded. A new interpreter now applies the defaults above.
- Process bindings stay opt-in. The wasm module rejects `procs`. The Node CLI spawns a process only for `--proc`.

### Fixed

- Pages output includes the wasm module, the SPA `404.html` fallback, and the canonical playground URL.

## [v0.3] - 2026-10-16

### Added

- `::|` steps between a pattern and its terminal operator. A step searches the whole state and binds captures for the rest of the rule. `{{name|quote}}` inserts a RE2 literal. `quote` chains with `pctenc` and `pctdec`.
- First numbered spec (`SPEC_VERSION`), the manifest schema (`docs/conformance.md`), and the CLI contract for another implementation (`docs/implementers.md`).
- `tools/example_runner.py --impl NAME=COMMAND` runs that command in the same parity set as Python, Go, and wasm.
- The wasm host is in that parity set.
- Python `--max-steps` and `--max-state-bytes`, with shared manifests under `examples/limits`.
- Playwright covers the playground example menu, stepping, and the embed route. GitLab CI runs that suite.

### Changed

- **Breaking:** a value filled into a `::|` step is raw regex source. The first `::|` revision quoted every value. Quoting is now the `quote` filter.

### Fixed

- A process read still returns the line when the child exits as the host is reading. The wasm process host waits for stdout to end.
- Playground end-to-end tests follow the current example menu and wait for the editor.
